🎬 Pixar Films Analysis (1995–2024) | Power BI Dashboard
Data Visualization | Entertainment Analytics | Maven Analytics Challenge

This project explores the cinematic and commercial evolution of Pixar Animation Studios, from their debut with Toy Story (1995) to Inside Out 2 (2024). Using a structured dataset curated by Eric Leung and provided via a Maven Analytics Challenge, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights into Pixar’s filmography.

Imported and modeled data within Power BI

📊 Dashboard Features

💡 Key Insights
High budgets don’t always translate into box office success.

Award-winning films are not always the highest-rated by critics.

Sequels often outperform originals in earnings (e.g., Toy Story 3, Finding Dory).

Pixar’s films have matured in theme and tone over time, reflected in ratings and genres.
