🎬 Pixar Films Analysis (1995–2024) | Power BI Dashboard
Data Visualization | Entertainment Analytics | Maven Analytics Challenge

This project explores the cinematic and commercial evolution of Pixar Animation Studios, from their debut with Toy Story (1995) to Inside Out 2 (2024). Using a structured dataset curated by Eric Leung and provided via a Maven Analytics Challenge, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights into Pixar’s filmography.


🔍 Dataset Overview
Source: Maven Analytics / Eric Leung
Format: CSV
Records: 28 Pixar films
Fields: 22.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
Transformed raw column names into clean, human-readable headers

Ensured appropriate data types (e.g., integers for budgets, floats for ratings)

Verified dataset completeness (no null values)

Renamed and standardized columns for clarity

Imported and modeled data within Power BI

📊 Dashboard Features
Top Box Office Performers – Visual ranking of the most profitable films

Budget vs. Earnings Analysis – Scatter plots comparing investment vs. return

Critic Ratings vs. Awards – Identify critically acclaimed films and award winners

Sequels vs. Originals – Compare success metrics between sequels and their originals

Trend Analysis – Explore changes in genres, MPAA ratings, and thematic styles over time

Interactive Filters – Slice data by year, genre, sequel/original, and more

💡 Key Insights
High budgets don’t always translate into box office success.

Award-winning films are not always the highest-rated by critics.

Sequels often outperform originals in earnings (e.g., Toy Story 3, Finding Dory).

Pixar’s films have matured in theme and tone over time, reflected in ratings and genres.
